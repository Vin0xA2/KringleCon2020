(Initial message)
All the lollipops on this system have been stolen by munchkins. Capture munchkins by following instructions here and 🍭's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.


(Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a munchkin and retrieve a lollipop!)
~$ ls
  HELP  munchkin_19315479765589239  workshop


(Now find the munchkin inside the munchkin.)
~$ grep munchkin munchkin_19315479765589239
  munchkin_24187022596776786


(Great, now remove the munchkin in your home directory.)
~$ rm munchkin_19315479765589239


(Print the present working directory using a command.)
~$ pwd
  /home/elf


(Good job but it looks like another munchkin hid itself in you home directory. Find the hidden munchkin!)

(Excellent, now find the munchkin in your command history.)
~$ grep munchkin .bash_history

(Find the munchkin in your environment variables.)
~$ env | grep munchkin

(Munchkins have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.)
~$ cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical; mv blown_fuse0 fuse0


(Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0)
~$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1


(Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.)
~$ cp fuse1 fuse2


(We need to make sure munchkins don't come back. Add the characters "MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.)
~$ echo MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT >> fuse2


(Find the munchkin somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.)
~$ find /opt/munchkin_den/ -iname *munchkin* 2>/dev/null
