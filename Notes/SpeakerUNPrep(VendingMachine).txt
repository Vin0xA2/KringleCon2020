In-game terminal
Objective: Get the password for the ./vending-machines binary.
Hint:
  Try deleting or rename the config to set the password ourselves to AAAAAAAA or BBBBBBBB.
  Might be a simple rotation cypher.


(Run the binary to get the initial message.)
~$ ./vending-machines
  The elves are hungry!

  If the door's still closed or the lights are still off, you know because
  you can hear them complaining about the turned-off vending machines!
  You can probably make some friends if you can get them back on...

  Loading configuration from: /home/elf/lab/vending-machines.json

  I wonder what would happen if it couldn't find its config file? Maybe that's
  something you could figure out in the lab...

  Welcome, elf-maintenance! It looks like you want to turn the vending machines back on?
  Please enter the vending-machine-back-on code >


(See what's in the config file.)
~$ cat vending-machines.json
  {
    "name": "elf-maintenance",
    "password": "LVEdQPpBwr"
  }


(Let's try renaming the config file in the lab directory.)
~$ cd lab/
~$ mv vending-machines.json bending-machines.json
~$ ./vending-machines
  ...
  ALERT! ALERT! Configuration file is missing! New Configuration File Creator Activated!
  ...


(Looks like it just prompts to create a new name and password. Let's do 10x A's since original password has 10 characters.)
Please enter the name > 
Please enter the password > AAAAAAAAAA
  ...


(Let's see what the new config file looks like.)
~$ cat vending-machines.json
  {
    "name": "",
    "password": "XiGRehmwXi"
  }


(Doing all B's returns a different combination of letters. So it's more of a substitution instead of rotation cypher.)
(Run the binary with 10x A's as password, Ctrl+C out of it, and then rename the config file to AA.)
~$ ./vending-machines
Please enter the vending-machine-back-on code > ^C
~$ mv vending-machines.json AA


(Repeat with B's and renaming the config file to AB. C's and config file to AC. And so on with.)
(Grep for password to get a neat printout to look at.)
~$ $ grep password A*
  AA:  "password": "XiGRehmwXi"
  AB:  "password": "DqTpKv7fDq"
  AC:  "password": "Lbn3UP9WLb"
  ...


(Visually match up character by character.)
LVEdQPpBwr => CandyCane1


(Run the binary and give it the password.)
~$ ./vending-machines
Please enter the vending-machine-back-on code > CandyCane1
  Checking......

  Vending machines enabled!!
