(Start the game on impossible level and inspect the HTML.)
  Right click on "Redacted!" without quotes > Inspect


(The script section has seeds attempted. Copy it.)
  Right click > Copy > Copy element

      1135332398 - Not random enough
      2445138814 - Not random enough
  ...


(Cut the spaces in front and strings after the seeds.)
~$ cut -d " " -f 5 random.txt > random2.txt


(Install the predictor tool.)
~$ pip install mersenne-twister-predictor


(Feed the predictor the data.)
~$ cat random2.txt | mt19937predict > predicted.txt


(Ctrl+C to terminate it otherwise it will keep generating more numbers.)
(First line in predicted.txt should be the number we are looking for.)
(Use that as the Player Name in a separate instance of the game on Easy mode.)
(Solve it on Easy and then return to the Impossible session using the same enemy layout.)


Success!!
